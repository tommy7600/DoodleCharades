DoodleCharades
==============
Doodle Charades is a simple drawing game that me and a classmate made for our web programming class (CMPT 350) at the University of Saskatchewan. In this game one player is assigned a word to draw and the rest of the players have to try to guess what is being drawn. The server was written for use with Node JS, and requires the socket.io module in order to work correctly.
